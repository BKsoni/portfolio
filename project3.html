		<h3>House Price Prediction</h3>

		<p>
			The Boston House Price Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting housing prices in the city of Boston. The dataset used for this project contains various features related to different neighborhoods in Boston, such as average number of rooms per dwelling, crime rate, property tax rate, and more.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			By utilizing advanced regression algorithms and data analysis techniques, the model learns the relationships between the input features and the actual house prices. This allows it to make accurate predictions on the prices of houses based on new data.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The main goal of this project is to provide valuable insights to home buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in Boston. Potential home buyers can use the predicted prices to make informed decisions on which properties to consider, while sellers can gain an understanding of the market trends to set competitive prices for their houses.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared score to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Overall, the Boston House Price Prediction project is a powerful tool for anyone involved in the real estate market in Boston, aiding them in making smarter and more informed choices.
