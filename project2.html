      <h3>Mango orchard Estimation <a href="https://mango-detection-using-yolov8.streamlit.app/">(Live)</a></h3>
      <p>
        The Mango Orchard Estimation Project is an innovative application of
        computer vision and machine learning techniques to estimate the number
        of mangoes in a given orchard using YOLOv8 algorithm. This project
        involves the creation and utilization of a <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/MangoYOLO_data_set/13450661/2">custom dataset</a>, which
        includes images of mango orchards with annotated bounding boxes around
        individual mangoes.
      </p>
      <p>
        YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is a state-of-the-art object
        detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy in detecting and
        localizing objects within images. By training the YOLOv8 model on the
        custom mango dataset, it learns to recognize mangoes in various sizes,
        shapes, and orientations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process begins with data collection, where images of mango orchards
        are captured from drones or other aerial platforms, providing an aerial
        view of the entire orchard. These images are then carefully annotated
        with bounding boxes, indicating the location of each mango within the
        image.
      </p>
      <p>
        The annotated dataset is used to train the YOLOv8 model, where it learns
        to generalize mango detection and count across different orchards and
        varying conditions. The model is fine-tuned and optimized to achieve
        high accuracy and robustness in mango counting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the model is trained, it can be deployed in real-world scenarios to
        estimate the number of mangoes in a given mango orchard efficiently and
        accurately. This estimation is valuable for mango farmers, agricultural
        researchers, and fruit distributors to assess orchard productivity, plan
        harvests, and manage resources effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mango Orchard Estimation Project demonstrates the powerful synergy
        between computer vision, machine learning, and agricultural
        applications, making it an important tool for enhancing mango farming
        and management practices.
